This is a widget manager application, supporting the following operations:

* add widget
* remove widget
* list all widgets

## The Widget

The widget has the following fields:

* x
* y
* width
* height
* z

### z - zOrder
The widget's zOrder (z) is unique. If Z-index is not specified, the widget moves to foreground
Foreground - max Z, background - min Z.

If the existing z is specified when creating or updating widget, then the new widget shifts old widget(s) upwards.
